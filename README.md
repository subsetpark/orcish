# Orcish translator

This is a rather straight-ahead translation of a small application by @patrickomalley, intended to demonstrate the performance of idiomatic Nim at string handling.

## Instructions:

compile with `nim c -d:release orcish`.

### Usage:

run `./orcish` for a small demonstration on a single paragraph.

run ./orcish <filename> to garble a text file, at a different level of proficiency for each line.
